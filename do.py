#(print) this is the feature which prints the word given ahead of it

print("hi, i am a text") # this is the function the word inside of the "" will come as output 

# lets try numbers

print(2020, "was bad") # this works with numbers and text but the "" shall not be included with the number because it is of no use

print("text 3 \n") 

# the special thing here is that the  "\n" is actually creating a new sentence 

### For the next one we need a clean work space first we create a few "terms" like

a = 5 - 3

print("my answer is \n" "a = ", a)
